  <b>Brief Overview:</b><br>

	<p>PARATREET is a parallel tree toolkit that allows the rapid development of tree-based applications on parallel platforms. This framework will support a variety of space-partitioning methods and the associated trees, including octrees [6,7], kd-trees [8,9], inside-outside trees [10], ball trees [11], R-trees [12], and their combinations.</p>
 
	<p>Details of data partitioning and communication are hidden from the programmer using an internally managed decomposition module and an asynchronous software-based tree data cache, which will maintain a writeback local copy of remote tree data. With PARATREET, a programmer will be able to quickly evaluate the relative merits of different trees and algorithms even when applied to large datasets and very computation-intensive applications.</p>
 
	<p>The combination of an abstract and extensible framework with a portable adaptive runtime system will allow scientists the effective use of parallel hardware ranging from small clusters to petascale-class machines, for a wide variety of tree-based applications.</p>
 
<b>Background</b>
 
<p>According to Knuth (The Art of Computer Programming), "trees [are] the most important nonlinear structures in computer algorithms." Scientific and visualization codes that need to describe objects in multi-dimensional space have a particularly compelling need for trees, since data can be naturally described in a tree hierarchy. A neighbor relationship can also be easily inferred by the proximity of nodes in the tree structure. Hence kd-trees and other space-partitioning trees (such as octrees and quadtrees) are commonly used to speed up geometric problems that these applications face.</p>
 
<p>The need for increased computational power and parallel hardware makes hierarchical organization more compelling. In computer graphics, as models move from thousands to billions of polygons, and rendering hardware transitions from gigaflop CPUs to teraflop GPUs and petaflop clusters, applications are moving toward hierarchical data structures such as bounding volume hierarchies (BVH).</p>
 
<p>As another example, in cosmology Cold Dark Matter large scale structure simulations have moved from only 30,000 particles simulating galaxy clusters a few megaparsecs in size inside volumes less than 100 megaparsecs across [1] (for a dynamic range of 30), to much finer resolution at high dynamic ranges: more than 10^12 particles in gigaparsec survey volumes that contain galaxy clusters a few megaparsecs across; the clusters comprise 100 kiloparsec galaxies, along with their satellites, which are kiloparsecs in size [2, e.g.], resulting in a spatial dynamic range of order 10^6.</p>
 
<p>Tree data structures, and the algorithms that can be developed on top of them, are extremely valuable to be able to deploy and scale such applications effectively, especially in the emerging petaflop regime and beyond.</p>
 
<p>For a linear structure like an array or regular grid, parallel languages such as UPC [3], ZPL [4] and Co-array Fortran [5] have demonstrated increased programmer productivity without sacrificing parallel performance.</p>
 
<p>The use of PARATREET abstractions is aimed at significantly easing the implementation of tree algorithms. This is particularly true for parallel implementations where a fairly trivial algorithmic component requires significant implementation effort, e.g. visiting the next element in a data structure might require communication with the processor on which it is located.</p>
